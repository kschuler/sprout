# sprout ðŸŒ±

**sprout** is a lightweight R package that helps beginners take their first steps in data science.

It includes:
- Encouraging messages (`sprout_encourage()`, `sprout_tip()`, etc.)
- Small, friendly datasets for practice (coming soon!)
- A simple, approachable design for learning in the browser (especially via Google Colab)

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub:

```r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yourusername/sprout")

```
